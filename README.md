This system is the combination of software and hardware based technologies. Hardware is
comprised of microcontroller which is connected to sensors , Wi-Fi module and relays ,
appliances can be controlled under given conditions. Software based part is comprised of an
application which utilizes the energy usage data of appliances. From every corner of the world,
household appliances can be controlled in the proposed smart efficient energy house automation.
With smart energy monitoring system, track power consumption for single or multiple devices.
Identify abnormal patterns of energy use , Estimate your energy bill, allowing you to see the
overall impact of energy use on your wallet. By analyzing the energy consumption user can
reduce the energy usage in which the application allowed to set a limit for energy consumption.
Whenever the usage crossed a threshold limit the application will alert the user. Also it provides
suggestions inorder to reduce the energy consumption. 
The system is beneficial for electricity saving as it overcomes electricity consumption, which is
the main target to achieve as unwanted appliances will be automatically switched off according to
given conditions. It allows to reduce power consumption in home by continuously monitoring the
power consumed and allow the user to view the estimated cost for the usage. E-mail notifications
are sent to the user as Alert messages sot that the user may consume the power more carefully.
Also provides ease and comfort to the user. It is cost-efficient in terms of electricity usage of
hardware/software. The system is effective and reliable.
